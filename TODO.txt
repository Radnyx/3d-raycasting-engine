DEVELOPMENT LOG:

PreAlpha 0.0.5 - June 12th, 2016: Small, complicated beginnings
    + Raytraced square walls with texture
    + Floor and ceiling tiles with texture
    + Distance fog/shading
    + Smooth movement/acceleration
    + Mouse look horizontally and vertically
    + Loading level from file (simply a .PNG telling if a block is there)
    + Wall collision detection

PreAlpha 0.0.6 - June 14th, 2016: A perfect Raycaster
    + Fixed FOV rendering, adjustable
    * Wall and floor now exactly align perfectly

PreAlpha 0.0.7 - June 18th, 2016: Sprites!!!
    + Added Sprites
    + Slightly shade walls on side to look cooler
    * Log with videos now saved on Google Drive

PreAlpha 0.0.8 - June 26th, 2016: Textures!!!
    + Adjustable ceiling height, the blocks stick to this height for now (wrapping the texture around)
    + Adjustable camera height (within floor/ceiling limit)
        * Head bob is now rotational and vertical
    + Sky texture in background now can replace ceiling
    + Map Editor: Gemakt v0.1
        + Save/Load map files with textures
        + Assign textures to floor, wall, and ceiling
    + Loads maps with wall and floor textures

PreAlpha 0.0.9 - July 4th, 2016: Verticallity Technicallity
    * Renderer Refactoring
        * Fixed Sprite height scaling
        * DrawFloor no longer has its own function, to reduce overdraw, the floor
            is simply drawn in vertical strips after a wall; using a calculated
            depth look-up table for that frame
        * Sky Texture now draws until the start of the wall for that vertical line
    + On texture-less ground, draws an abyss-hole down
        ~ Looks very nice, but still needs work as non-darkened sides have a darkened stripe
    + Blocks (walls) may have different heights, taller visible behind shorter ones
        * Sprites layer based on a 2D depth-buffer now
    * Fixed Sky Texture on different resolutions

PreAlpha 0.1.0 - :
    (Sloped walls)


TODO:

[X] Fix goddamn rendering and fov
[X] Sprites
[~] Crouching? Figure out verticality, even though this is kind of on the further TODO
    * So turns out looking down/up on top of many blocks doesn't work because
        the wall drawing algorithm stops at the nearest block. I don't really
        want to extend the code to allow some 2-d depth buffer or whatever.
    * Vertical motion, again within floor/ceiling limit
[X] Wall/Floor textures
[X] Map Editor support
    [X] Instead of .PNG, encoded map data
    [X] Maps will select necessary textures to be loaded (texture folder)
    [ ] Will give spawn location of player, direction, etc.
[X] Draw infinite vertical abyss in absent floor (using wall texture, perhaps)
[ ] Diagonal walls
[ ] Text Drawing
[ ] Pause Menu (Menus in general, separate from game process)


Further TODO:

[X] Background (sky etc.)
[ ] NPCs (walking around/turning/colliding etc.)
[ ] Flat (sliding) gates/doors
[ ] Elevation?
    [~] Higher/lower block/walls // Ended up just having some walls taller than others
    [!] Partial floor/ceiling drawing // I don't think this will be a feature
    - Slopes?? (or stairs)
